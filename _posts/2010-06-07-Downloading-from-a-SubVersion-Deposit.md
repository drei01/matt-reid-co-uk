This is a quick post for anyone who has ever browsed subversioned
sourcecode (such as on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/)) and
facied a working copy of the code to look at offline. Here goes:
-   Download Tortoise SVN [here](http://tortoisesvn.net/)
-   Install Tortoise SVN
-   Open command prompt
-   Type    `svn checkout http://node-name/repos/svn/trunk/parentPath`{style="font-style: italic;"}`where`` node-name/.... `{style="font-style: italic;"}`is the URL for the repository.`

You now have a working copy.Matt :)Â
