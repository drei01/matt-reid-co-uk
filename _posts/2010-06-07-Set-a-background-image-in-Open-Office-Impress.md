title: Set a background image in Open Office Impress
---

This is something that frustrated me for a long time. Open Office
Impress is powerful and importantly free but it is not the most
user-friendly software. These tips were found on [nevil
jose's](http://neviljose.wordpress.com/2008/01/09/setting-custom-slide-background-on-openoffice-impress/)
blog.
1) Go to **Format** / **Area** (Yes, believe me! We start going to
“Format Area” )

2) Choose BITMAPS on the window and click the Import button

3) Name your imported bitmap

4) Go to **View** / **Master** / **Slide Master**

5) Right click on a free area of the slide and go to **Slide** / **Page
Setup**

6) On the background tab, choose bitmaps from the drop-down menu and
select your previously created bitmap.
