title: Ubuntu 10.04 and DWL-G510 Wifi card
---

I have recently installed ubuntu 10.04 on my 7 year old pc to give it
some new life as a media server(more blogs on the installation soon
hopefully).One of the problems I had to overcome during the installation was
installing my pci wifi card from D-Link.After some googling, I managed to combine 2 tutorials to great effect to
get the driver installed via ndiswrapper.Here are the steps that I took:
1.  Follow the instructions to install ndiswrapper provided by this
    tutorial but do not continue beyond the
    installation.[Here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper)
2.  Follow the instructions to get the correct driver from this tutorial
    but do no follow the installation instructions.

Finally, clickSystem -> Administration -> Windows Wireless Driversand follow the prompts to install the driver![](http://i30.tinypic.com/33tm682.png)Â
