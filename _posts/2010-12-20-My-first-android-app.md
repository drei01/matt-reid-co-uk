title: My first android app!
---

I am proud to announce the release of my very first Android app,
FixtureFeed.

You may have already guessed by my recent posts about troubles with
uploading apps via the developer console.

I wrote the app in conjunction with [Hannah
Suppiah](http://hannahsuppiah.blogspot.com/) (designing all the
graphics).

This app is our first outing under the name CodeFish, I plan to get my
[Projects Page](http://matt-reid.co.uk/projects.php) live very soon to
amalgamate all the CodeFish goodness!!

You can check it out as a FREE download by pointing your QRcode reader
below, or if you are reading this on your android device, [click here
from android browser](market://search?q=pname:org.codefish.fixturefeed)

Enjoy,

Matt
