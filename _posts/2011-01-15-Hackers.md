title: Hackers!
---

My website has only been running from my own server (more on that soon!)
for a few days but I"m already seeing hacking attempts. Gah!

One such attempt by someone who calls themself *ZmEu* goes as such:

``` {.js name="code"}
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:52 +0000] "GET /w00tw00t.at.blackhats.romanian.anti-sec:) HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:52 +0000] "GET /phpMyAdmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:52 +0000] "GET /phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:52 +0000] "GET /pma/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:53 +0000] "GET /myadmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
216.234.117.7 80.228.163.29 - [16/Jan/2011:20:38:53 +0000] "GET /MyAdmin/scripts/setup.php HTTP/1.1" 404 345 "-" "ZmEu"
```

Obviously I"m not stupid enough to have phpmyadmin running but still,
what does this guy want with my measly website?!?!

I decided to take a quick look at mr *ZmEu*"s IP (presuming the he is
making these requests from his own IP address). It seems pretty
fruitful:

I am not going to try and counter attack this guy, in case he turns out
to be some potato eating, vodka swigging mafioso from russia but I am
still frustrated!
