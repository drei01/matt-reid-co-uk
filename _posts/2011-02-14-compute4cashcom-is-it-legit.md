title: compute4cash.com is it legit?
---

I came across [this blog
post](http://www.i-programmer.info/news/141-cloud-computing/1992-sell-your-unused-gpu-cycles.html)
about a site called [compute4cash.com](http://www.compute4cash.com)
which pays you money to run a small program that uses your free GPU
cycles to do calculations (using
[OpenCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL---)).

I looked up the whois for the site and read their FAQ and was left with
some serious questions about the legitimacy of this site.

-   Who runs this and where from
-   What are they computing and is it legal
-   Why are they going to such lengths to hide their identity

All in all, this site seems to be too good to be true.

I emailed the site asking these questions and here is the response I
got.

This left a lot of questions answered (and is the reason I won't be
giving up my day job and buying a load of second-hand graphics cards).

By comparing their site to Fold-At-Home they are trying to affirm their
legitimacy but [[email protected]](cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html)
has a very clear objective and has accountable owners, things which
compute4cash have not provided.
They have also failed to mention the purpose of their computations, they
must be getting the data to crunch from somewhere and they must be being
paid for it in order to make money from the site.

One to watch but not participate in is my verdict.
