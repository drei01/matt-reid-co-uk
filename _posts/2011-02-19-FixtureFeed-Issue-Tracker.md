title: FixtureFeed Issue Tracker
---

I have finally got round to getting an issue tracker for
[FixtureFeed](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.codefish.fixturefeed)
and am using the wonderful [cubeon](http://code.google.com/p/cubeon/) to
track issues in netbeans.

You can track the latest issues on [FixtureFeed Google Code
![](http://www.gstatic.com/codesite/ph/images/defaultlogo.png)](http://code.google.com/p/fixturefeed/issues/list)

I am planning to use google project hosting to track issues for all the
CodeFish apps so watch this space.
