title: Android- Ads in notification bar
---

So an ad network has come up with a **novel** idea to help android
developers make money from their apps by forcing the user to upgrade to
their paid version.








I became aware of this when I was reading the update notes for the app
[APNdroid](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.code.apndroid) and
noticed that the app would start to *display ads in notification bar.*
The note was keen to stress that it was only 1 ad per day but I decided
against updating the app and it certainly didn't make me want to upgrade
to the paid version.










Here is the promo video for the notification ads:















As an android developer myself I was interested to see if this approach
actually worked and the full evidence suggesting **no** is shown in the
reviews of APNdroid.










After several hundred 1 star reviews the developer (Martin Adamek)
posted an update to the app which removed the adverts stating













> Removed notification ads. Thanks for the feedback, it has been
> enormous. And yes, I am an idiot.

Lesson learned. Users don't like having adverts forces on them at
*convenient times*
