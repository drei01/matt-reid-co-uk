title: Android- application not installed
---

Recently I have been getting the error "application not installed" when
trying to install apps to my sd card. This is just a quick post to share
my solution to the problem.






The Solution
------------



Plug your phone into your pc via usb cable or mount the sd card and
delete the file **smdl2tmp1.asec**
from the folder **.android_secure**
then mount the sd card back on the phone and all will be good
