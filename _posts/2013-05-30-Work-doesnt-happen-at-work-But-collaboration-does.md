title: Work doesn't happen at work. But collaboration does.
---

Watching
the TED presentation **Why work doesn't happen at work** by Jason
Fried, I was struck by the similarities with the office I work in (and
many other offices across the world). He makes some good points about
people"s productivity in "the office" but I don"t think this is a one
sided argument. Here are some things he neglected to mention.






#### You can"t collaborate in isolation



If everybody worked from a place where they had maximum concentration,
we would get stuck in our own world. Streams of work are not linear,
priorities change and very few of us have our whole year planned out in
terms of projects we can work on alone without input from others. If you
need input from others, then how can you work in isolation?
Collaboration is key to driving the stream of work forwards.








#### Distractions from colleagues happen for a reason



People want your opinion. If you are getting distracted a few times a
day by people asking you questions, you are a valuable resource to them.
That doesn"t make your day wasted, you have provided information to
others that helps them get on with their own job.








#### Balance is the key



Balancing time concentrating on work and time where you allow
distractions/collaboration is the key to working smart. I
don"t believe Jason"s presentation is something we should act on; merely
listen, understand and bear in mind when you have
unnecessary distractions.










Speaking of which...
