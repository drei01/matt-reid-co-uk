title: Responsive background-image picturefill
---

Responsive images are all the rage these days with the advent of
HTML5/CSS3 webapps. In order to improve the speed of our webapps on
mobiles, we don"t want to be sending huge 500kb images to a tiny mobile
browser and have them scaled down by our responsive @media queries.








That"s where [picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)
comes to the rescue, a handy javascript library that requests images of
appropriate sizes (bases on any media query you like).










This is fantastic for **img** tags but what about css background images?
Well some nifty media queries come to the rescue.
