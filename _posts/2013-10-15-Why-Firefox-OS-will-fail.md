title: Why Firefox OS will fail
---

In
this post I will explain (based on very little background research) why
Firefox os is using the wrong app submission process. I will conclude
that Firefox os ultimate demise will be caused by a lack of apps. you
have been warned.I
should start by saying I really like the idea behind Firefox OS, it
fills a gap where low-end android phones are failing to capitalise. I
was fortunate enough to go to Norfolk"s first mobile developer
conference mobdevcon. Speaking at the conference was Ruth Jones, a
researcher for O2. Ruth was talking on Firefox OS and gave a brief
demonstration of how easy it is to build an app for the platform using
existing HTML5 and JavaScript technologies. Inspired during her talk, I
was able to submit [my responsive HTML5 app](http://www.bakeoff.co) to
the Firefox marketplace. Fantastic I thought, with the simple addition
of a manifest json file my app would be live before I could say "Steve
Jobs".The
following day I received this email from the Firefox marketplace
team.










*After reviewing your App submission to the Firefox Marketplace, we have
determined that it does not currently meet our requirements for public
listing.*

*App: BakeOff*

*Comments:*





*All external links need to open with target="_blank" - there is no
browser UX in a webapp and on Desktop and FirefoxOS platforms there is
no hardware back button. This includes adverts and links to other parts
of your website that have no navigation back to the "app"*

*Tested on Unagi and Keon, Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Tab with Firefox
Mobile, Firefox Aurora*

*Once the concerns above have been addressed, you may resubmit your App
from its Manage Status page

There
is no explanation as to what I should do to mitigate a lack of hardware
back button. I have no external links on my app as far as I know and
there are no dead ends. the application logo acts as a universal home
button as it does with many websites and
[apps](http://www.bakeoff.co).I
responded to Mozilla support explaining as above that I don"t believe
their concerns are valid. I received a cc"d email to another Mozilla
employee asking him to respond to my comments and then
nothing....I
am yet to get a response from Mozilla and this is why Firefox os will
fail. [My app](http://www.bakeoff.co) may not be the greatest in the
world but sooner or later someone will come along with the next big app.
If they get a response at all they will probably find they do not fit
the exact criteria for inclusion in the Firefox os store and they will
go and find an easier platform to publish on (android).








p.s
if you are into baking you should check out
[BakeOff.co](http://www.bakeoff.co) - the app I was trying to
submit.
