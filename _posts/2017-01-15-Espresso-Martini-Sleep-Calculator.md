title: Espresso Martini Sleep Calculator
---

### The idea
While joking around with friends, I had the idea for an espresso martini sleep calculator. The premise is, *when will I be able to get to sleep given the numer of espresso martinis I've had*. This was a fun little project that I wrote in about 15 minutes on codepen and thought I'd share.

### The result

Based on 3 hours per espresso shot to get through your system.
